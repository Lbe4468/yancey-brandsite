                                    <p>We are a global training and education company. We teach entrepreneurs and investors
                                        how to grow and protect their income. We're heavily involved in traditional avenues,
                                        such as real estate and stocks, but we also provide training on unique topics relevant
                                        to today's economy - and tomorrow's.
                                        <br />
                                        <br /> Our customers learn how to profit in real estate without spending their own money
                                        on properties or the time on renovations. They might find out how to tap into capital
                                        they didn't know they have. Customers learn they don't need to settle for small returns
                                        in their retirement or brokerage accounts - there are a variety of better options.
                                        Many more topics are covered and are available at whatever detail you want. Our goal
                                        is to give you incredible training, resources, and help along the way so that you
                                        can get more out of life and find personal freedom.

                                        As much as every celebrity or guru would like to attend and personally meet every person, they do not attend most events.
                                        They have partnered with our experienced trainers, who will host the event and guide
                                        you through the education.

                                        feature various prizes. Each promotion has specific entry and selection rules. Please
                                        see the promotion terms on your advertisement or ticket for more information.

                                        Wear whatever you're comfortable in. The important thing is that you come ready to learn. We'll be dressed in matching slacks
                                        and polos so we're easy to spot - most of our guests wear business casual for a positive
                                        networking experience.

                                        in case. If you don't see them, or you're unable to print them, no worries - we will

                                        Business partners and significant others are important to your success as an entrepreneur and investor. We encourage you
                                        to bring them if you can. Children, however, will not be admitted. Seating is limited,
                                        and we only have enough spots for those with tickets who are at least 18 years of
                                        age. You can tell them all about it when you get home.

                                        Our events fill up quickly so plan on arriving 15-30 minutes early (remember to account for time to park and find the conference
                                        room). You will need to check in with our staff. If you arrive late, there's a chance
                                        we'll be out of space.
                                        <br />
                                        <br /> Out of respect for our guests, we will start on-time, but you will probably have
                                        a few minutes to get to know our staff and mingle with like-minded entrepreneurs.
                                        The event will last approximately 3 hours, with the keynote event taking place the
                                        first 45-60 minutes.

                                        Some events include lunch of dinner (check your ticket to confirm). If your ticket shows that a meal is included, please
                                        plan to be served after the keynote presentation (close to 90 minutes after the start
                                        time). Meal variety will vary and depend on the venue where the event will be held
                                        - meals usually include sandwiches, chips, cookies, and drinks. If you're really
                                        hungry, you may want to grab a small snack beforehand, so you're not starving and
                                        distracted until meals are served.
